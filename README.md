# Msqa_Thesis_2025
 This thesis proposes a hybrid approach that merges multi-modal object grounding with situation-aware 3D semantic segmentation. We aim to build a system that can interpret natural language queries and visual references to identify and segment objects in a 3D scene, enhanced by an understanding of the user's spatial situation.
